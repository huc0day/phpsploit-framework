The client is written in JAVA language, and the server is implemented in PHP language (due to the limitations of PHP language itself, the technical implementation of the server is still in further optimization). In CTF competitions, if you feel that public chat software may be breached and utilized by red teams, then in special scenarios, this module function can also become another option worth considering (although the server implementation, even the author himself, thinks it is not perfect ^ _ ^).Warning! When you start a server chat environment instance in the web interface, other functions in the current web environment will become unusable! If the target host for your current penetration testing or security audit behavior is still running other businesses, you should never use this feature in the web environment, as it will make other businesses in the web environment unusable! The functionality of this module is currently only applicable to web environments without other business operations, as well as relatively independent command-line environments!</div>';

During CTF matches, it can be used to break through the filtering and interception of data communication by the Blue Team firewall), using temporarily issued communication tokens for communication authentication. When you use the (reverse shell) mode to send shell environment commands, You need to carry a temporary token every time the command is sent For security reasons, when you want to use your specific encapsulated custom server, the temporary token sent along with the command can play a certain authentication role. This is mainly to prevent third-party applications from intervening in the protocol layer and impersonating your identity to send command information to the client. Of course, this setting may bring some inconvenience to your operation, such as when sending a command every time, you need to Use this format: ' . Class_Base_Format::htmlentities ( "<token> <shell command>" ) . '). In order to be compatible with the usage habits of most moral hackers, in addition to this (reverse shell) mode, the Phpsploit Framework software also provides a (background_shell) background mode to achieve the traditional rebound connection shell environment.Please note that all tokens published in this instance (reverse_shell) are only valid in the client shell environment created in that instance. When the Client Shell environment shuts down and restarts, a new communication token will be generated, and the old communication token will become invalid!

Before officially clicking the `submit` button, you should keep in mind the dynamically generated `User, Password, Cli Token` and other information, as they will be used to log in to the web or command - line environment of the Phpsploit Framework software!If you do not remember the above information, it will cause you to be unable to use the Phpsploit Framework software properly!If you forget information such as` User, Password, Cli Token `, you need to contact the server administrator of the environment where the Phpsploit Framework software is located and have them take corresponding actions on the shared memory . In general, the Phpsploit Framework software uses shared memory with KEY `0x5d8a0000` and KEY `0x5d8a0001` to store login information for the Phpsploit Framework software . However, it is not ruled out that other software will use these two shared memory resources, and you need to identify them according to the specific situation!If the shared memory with KEY of `0x5d8a0000` and KEY of `0x5d8a0001` is occupied by the Phpsploit Framework software, in a scenario where no special unexpected circumstances occur, the access permission to the shared memory with KEY of `0x5d8a0000` is `660`, and the space size of the shared memory with KEY of `0x5d8a0000` is `32 bytes`; The access permission for shared memory with KEY `0x5d8a0001` is` 660 `, and the space size for shared memory with KEY` 0x5d8a0001 `is` 1048712 bytes` . You can view shared memory information through the ipcs -m command ( which may require sufficient access and operation permissions), and you can use the ipcrm -M ' . Class_Base_Format::htmlentities ( '<shmem key>' ) . ' command to clean up specified shared memory resources.Appropriate shared memory cleaning operations can reset the login authentication information of Phpsploit Framework software! However, you must take it seriously and maintain a cautious attitude towards the cleaning of shared memory. Improper memory data cleaning operations may lead to system or software and hardware resources crashing, damaging, and related storage data loss and damage!\')){this.type="submit";return true;}else{this.type="button";return false;}}</script>' ,
