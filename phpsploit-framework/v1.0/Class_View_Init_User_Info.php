Before officially clicking the `submit` button, you should keep in mind the dynamically generated `User, Password, Cli Token` and other information, as they will be used to log in to the web or command - line environment of the Phpsploit Framework software!If you do not remember the above information, it will cause you to be unable to use the Phpsploit Framework software properly!If you forget information such as` User, Password, Cli Token `, you need to contact the server administrator of the environment where the Phpsploit Framework software is located and have them take corresponding actions on the shared memory . In general, the Phpsploit Framework software uses shared memory with KEY `0x5d8a0000` and KEY `0x5d8a0001` to store login information for the Phpsploit Framework software . However, it is not ruled out that other software will use these two shared memory resources, and you need to identify them according to the specific situation!If the shared memory with KEY of `0x5d8a0000` and KEY of `0x5d8a0001` is occupied by the Phpsploit Framework software, in a scenario where no special unexpected circumstances occur, the access permission to the shared memory with KEY of `0x5d8a0000` is `660`, and the space size of the shared memory with KEY of `0x5d8a0000` is `32 bytes`; The access permission for shared memory with KEY `0x5d8a0001` is` 660 `, and the space size for shared memory with KEY` 0x5d8a0001 `is` 1048712 bytes` . You can view shared memory information through the ipcs -m command ( which may require sufficient access and operation permissions), and you can use the ipcrm -M ' . Class_Base_Format::htmlentities ( '<shmem key>' ) . ' command to clean up specified shared memory resources.Appropriate shared memory cleaning operations can reset the login authentication information of Phpsploit Framework software! However, you must take it seriously and maintain a cautious attitude towards the cleaning of shared memory. Improper memory data cleaning operations may lead to system or software and hardware resources crashing, damaging, and related storage data loss and damage!\')){this.type="submit";return true;}else{this.type="button";return false;}}</script>' ,
